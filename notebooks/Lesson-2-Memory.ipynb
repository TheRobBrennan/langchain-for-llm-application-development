We could also showcase the new AI-powered recommendation engine that we've been working on, which can provide personalized product recommendations based on user preferences and behavior. Additionally, we could highlight the improvements we've made to the chatbot interface, which now has enhanced conversational abilities and can handle more complex user queries.\"}"
